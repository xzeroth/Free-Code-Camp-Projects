                    A <code>digital single-lens reflex camera (digital SLR or DSLR)</code> is 
                    a digital camera that combines the optics and the mechanisms 
                    of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, 
                    as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is 
                    the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. 
                    In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a 
                    mirror that alternates to send the image to either the viewfinder 
                    or the image sensor. The traditional alternative would be to have 
                    a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term "single lens" for 
                    this design. By using only one lens, the viewfinder of a DSLR 
                    presents an image that will not differ substantially from what 
                    is captured by the camera's sensor. A DSLR differs from non-reflex 
                    single-lens digital cameras in that the viewfinder presents a direct 
                    optical view through the lens, rather than being captured by the camera's 
                    image sensor and displayed by a digital screen.

                Auto Mode
            </header>
            <p>
                    Usually this mode is signified by a green box with or without 
                    the word “AUTO” in it or a little green camera icon. Automatic 
                    mode is exactly what it sounds like; it allows you to turn your
                     DSLR into a fancy point and shoot camera. In this mode, your 
                     camera will survey the area within your frame, (what you see 
                     when you look through the viewfinder,) for lighting conditions.
                      Then it makes an educated guess on what your focus point or
                       points, aperture, shutter speed, white balance, ISO and any
                        other pertinent settings should be. Modern digital cameras 
                        are so smart this whole process takes less than a second. 
                        While easy to use, auto-mode gives you little to no control 
                        of anything including what your camera focuses on.

        <section class="main-section" id="Aperture-Priorty_Mode">
            <header>Aperture-Priority Mode</header>
            <p><code>Aperture priority mode is typically denoted by A or AV depending
                 on what brand of camera you have.</code> This mode allows you to set
                  your aperture and then the camera automatically changes the
                   other settings to make them work with the aperture you’ve 
                   chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The aperture is actually the width of the hole inside the 
                    lens that opens and closes. As the aperture widens (and the 
                    number indicating the aperture gets smaller) more light is 
                    let in. The aperture controls two main components of your 
                    photograph; the first is the amount of light that reaches 
                    the camera’s internal sensor. The other element of your 
                    photograph that aperture modifies is the depth of focus.
                     Very simply put, the wider your aperture the smaller your
                      depth of focus. If depth of focus is your main concern, 
                      this might be the right shooting mode for you.</p>

                <code>Shutter priority can be selected by turning the dial to S or 
                TV depending on your camera.</code> Shutter priority mode allows you 
                to select the shutter speed and then the camera adjusts the
                 aperture to a value that will work with the shutter speed you’ve
                  selected to create a properly exposed photograph.
            </p>
            <p>Shutter speed controls how quickly or slowly your shutter closes.
                 This allows you to control that amount of light that goes into 
                 the lens. The longer the shutter is open the more time the light 
                 has to get into the camera and hit the sensor to create the image.
                  It also controls how much movement is visible in your photo. As the
                   shutter speed increases movement is frozen, whereas decreasing 
                   the shutter speed increases the visibility of motion. If
                    portraying or freezing movement is your main concern, shutter 
                    priority is a good place to start.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Manual_Mode">
            <header>Manual Mode</header>
            <p><code>Manual mode is almost always marked with an M.</code> This is the bicycle 
                without the training wheels. The camera is done whispering the 
                answer when the teachers back is turned. Manual mode means you get
                 to have complete control over every aspect of your photograph 
                 including choosing your shutter speed, ISO, aperture, white
                  balance, and focus points. Essentially, you can change pretty
                   much everything and in doing so, fine-tune the resulting
                    photograph.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Program_mode">
            <header>Program Mode</header>
            <p>Okay, so program mode is kind of confusing for two reasons.
                 The first reason is that on some cameras the P stands for 
                 auto mode instead of program mode. If your camera doesn’t 
                 seem to have an automatic mode, it’s a pretty good bet turning
                  that dial to the P will do the trick.</p>
            <p><code>The other reason it’s a wee bit puzzling is that program mode
                 is like automatic mode except you have the ability to change
                  select settings like turning the flash off or on, and manually
                   setting your white balance.</code> The capabilities of the program 
                   mode differ by brand and camera model. Some will allow you to
                    adjust settings like the ISO and focus points, others will
                     allow you to an aperture/shutter combination, while others 
                     again will have more limited options. I use this mode when 
                     I want to turn my flash off but keep the rest of the settings
                      in auto.</p>
